 How to tell whether a TV show would provide you with a good experience without watching it

## A really disappointing watching experience:

For years, I have been a big fan of the HBO series, [Game of Thrones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones). Once upon a time, I have even traveled to Ireland to ‘worship’ the show’s shooting scene.
