# How to avoid disappointing shows as GOT Season 8 and find your favored ones?--A Emotional Arc Approach Using Sentiment Analysis of the Scripts 

We all have had such experience as we are watching new movies or shows with high expectations, only to find our expectations subverted after the hours which seem like ages. But by then, those hours in our life had already gone, leaving us with only the disapointment and regrets. 

## A really disappointing watching experience:

For years, I have been a big fan of the HBO series, [Game of Thrones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones). Once upon a time, I have even travelled to Ireland to ‘worship’ the show’s shooting scene.

So it wouldn't be hard to imagine the joy and the expectation I had in 2019 when the last season of the show was premiered. I have my own self media with near 55k followers in [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/cao-tu-dou-94), so that I wrote several reviewing articles on the show and gained over 1.3 million views.

Some of the articles(Written in Chinese) are listed below:

However, the joy did not last long. it then turned out that the last season was the worst among all the seasons and received a great amount of complaints. Frankly speaking, I would rather haven’t watched the Game of Thrones season 8 so that it would have remained my favorite show ever till now!

I am not the only disappointed fan. A [petition](https://www.change.org/p/hbo-remake-game-of-thrones-season-8-with-competent-writers) was started in the [Change.org](https://www.change.org/p/hbo-remake-game-of-thrones-season-8-with-competent-writers) Wesite, hoping to "Remake Game of Thrones Season 8 with competent writers." Up till now, more than 1.8 million people have signed on the Internet.

Then a question bumped into my head: how can we avoid disappointing shows such as the last season of Game of Thrones and locate our favored ones? 

## We have ways to avoid disappointing shows, but...

Normally, we use the ways below to "filter" our favored shows:

***By watching the trailers***

--The trailer is re-edited, so it can be considered a competely different story from the oringal one. (BTW, even the last episode of the last season of GOT seems not bad)

***By reviewing the points and the recommendations on websites such as imdb***

--It helps， but most of the time the results are based on machine learning of labels and features on our viewing history on the website. As a result, the recommendations are highly genre-orientated, which is obviously not satisfying because a good story is narrative based rather than genre based. To make matters worse, the ratings are often somehow overated or under-estimated or "just not my type".  

***Through comments***

--I don’t want to take the risk of seeing spoilers. 

Unfortunately, we are faced with the fact that few of the current ways is satisfying. So new approach is supposed to be involved.

## A Narrative Approach: the Emotional Arc

Is there a new way to tell whether the show or the movie is "interesting" or "breath-taking" or just "dull", before you even watch it? 

It seems impossible at the first glance, as the saying goes: ‘You can’t have your cake and eat it too.’ 

But the digital technology has enabled us to use computational tools to analyze and generate the information we want from the screenplay script.

Think out about the question from very begining: What is the most significant thing that contributes to the processing of the story?
Engjoying a story, regardless of the format such as reading a book or watching a TV show, is getting various emotional experiences throughout the process, which is so called "The reader-pcerceived emotional content".

The emotional arc of the given story plays a very important role in the popularity of that story.(
